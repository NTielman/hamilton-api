    "lyrics": """How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore
    And a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot
    In the Caribbean by providence impoverished
    In squalor, grow up to be a hero and a scholar?
    The ten-dollar founding father without a father
    Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
    By being a lot smarter
    By being a self-starter
    By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter
    And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted away
    Across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
    Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
    The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter
    Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
    Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
    Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
    And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain
    Well, the word got around, they said, this kid is insane, man
    Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
    Get your education, don't forget from whence you came
    And the world is gonna know your name
    What's your name, man?
    Alexander Hamilton
    My name is Alexander Hamilton
    And there's a million things I haven't done
    But just you wait, just you wait
    When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
    Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
    Half-dead sittin' in their own sick, the scent thick
    And Alex got better but his mother went quick
    Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
    Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside
    A voice saying, "Alex, you gotta fend for yourself"
    He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf
    There would have been nothin' left to do for someone less astute
    He woulda been dead or destitute without a cent of restitution
    Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
    Tradin' sugar cane and rum and all the things he can't afford
    Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on
    Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on
    The bow of a ship headed for the new land
    In New York you can be a new man
    In New York you can be a new man (just you wait)
    In New York you can be a new man (just you wait)
    In New York you can be a new man
    In New York, New York
    Just you wait
    Alexander Hamilton
    Alexander Hamilton
    We are waiting in the wings for you
    Waiting in the wings for you
    You could never back down
    You never learned to take your time
    Oh, Alexander Hamilton
    Alexander Hamilton
    When America sings for you
    Will they know what you overcame?
    Will they know you rewrote your game?
    The world will never be the same, oh
    The ship is in the harbor now
    See if you can spot him (just you wait)
    Another immigrant comin' up from the bottom (just you wait)
    His enemies destroyed his rep America forgot him
    We, fought with him
    Me, I died for him
    Me, I trusted him
    Me, I loved him
    And me, I'm the damn fool that shot him (shot him, shot him)
    There's a million things I haven't done

    Pardon me.
    Are you Aaron Burr, sir?
    That depends. Who's asking?
    Oh, well, sure, sir
    I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
    I have been looking for you
    I'm getting nervous
    Sir...
    I heard your name at Princeton.
    I was seeking an accelerated course of study
    When I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours.
    I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir.
    He handles the financials?
    You punched the bursar
    Yes!
    I wanted to do what you did.
    Graduate in two, then join the revolution.
    He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid
    So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?
    It was my parents' dying wish before they passed
    You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
    God, I wish there was a war
    Then we could prove that we're worth more than anyone bargained for
    Can I buy you a drink?
    That would be nice
    While we're talking
    Let me offer you some free advice
    Talk less
    What?
    Smile more
    Ha
    Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for
    You can't be serious
    You wanna get ahead?
    Yes
    Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead
    Ay, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!
    What time is it?
    Showtime!
    Like I said...
    Showtime! Showtime! Yo!
    I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
    Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three!
    Those redcoats don't want it with me
    'Cause I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!
    Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
    The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
    I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
    Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best? C'est moi!
    Brrrah, brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
    Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?" (Ayy)
    Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
    It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets (Wow)
    No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
    Let's raise a couple more...
    To the revolution!
    Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!
    Aaron Burr!
    Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!
    Good luck with that: you're takin' a stand
    You spit. I'm 'a sit. We'll see where we land (Boooo)
    Burr, the revolution's imminent.
    What do you stall for?

    And I'm not throwin' away my shot
    I'ma get a scholarship to King's College
    I probably shouldn't brag, but dang, I amaze and astonish
    The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
    I gotta holler just to be heard
    With every word, I drop knowledge
    I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
    Tryna reach my goal my power of speech, unimpeachable
    Only nineteen but my mind is older
    These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
    Every burden, every disadvantage
    I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
    I walk these streets famished
    The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
    But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out my name
    I am the A-L-E-X-A-N-D-E-R we are meant to be
    A colony that runs independently
    Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
    Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
    Then King George turns around, runs a spendin' spree
    He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
    So there will be a revolution in this century
    Enter me, he says in parentheses
    Don't be shocked when your history book mentions me
    I will lay down my life if it sets us free
    Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy

    Hey yo, I'm just like my country
    I'm young, scrappy and hungry
    And I'm not throwin' away my shot
    It's time to take a shot
    I dream of life without a monarchy
    The unrest in France will lead to anarchy?
    Anarchy how you say, how you, oh, anarchy?
    When I fight, I make the other side panicky
    With my, shot
    Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
    And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis (loco parentis)
    I'm joining the rebellion 'cause I know it's my chance
    To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants (woo)
    I'm gonna take a shot
    And but we'll never be truly free
    Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
    You and I
    Do or die
    Wait 'til I sally in on a stallion
    With the first black battalion
    Have another shot
    Geniuses, lower your voices
    You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
    I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
    You've got to be carefully taught
    If you talk, you're gonna get shot
    Burr, check what we got
    Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
    I think your pants look hot
    Laurens, I like you a lot
    Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot
    What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
    Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
    A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
    Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is
    Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
    Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
    I never had a group of friends before
    I promise that I'll make y'all proud

    Rise up
    When you're living on your knees, you rise up
    Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up
    Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up
    When are these colonies gonna rise up? (Whoa, whoa)
    When are these colonies gonna rise up? (Whoa)
    When are these colonies gonna rise up? (Whoa)
    When are these colonies gonna rise up?
    Rise up
    I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
    When's it gonna get me?
    In my sleep, seven feet ahead of me?
    If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
    Is it like a beat without a melody?
    See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
    Where I come from some get half as many
    Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
    We have to make this moment last, that's plenty
    Scratch that this is not a moment, it's the movement
    Where all the hungriest brothers with something to prove went?
    Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
    We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
    And? If we win our independence?
    Is that a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
    Or will the blood we shed begin an endless cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
    I know the action in the street is excitin'
    But Jesus, between all the bleedin' 'n' fightin'
    I've been readin' 'n' writin'
    We need to handle our financial situation
    Are we a nation of states what's the state of our nation?
    I'm past patiently waitin' I'm passionately mashin' every expectation
    Every action's an act of creation
    I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
    For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow
    And I am not throwin' away my shot
    I am not throwin' away my shot
    Hey yo, I'm just like my country
    I'm young, scrappy and hungry

    Out-numbered, out-planned

    (Boom, boom, boom; boom, boom!)
    Check it —
    Can I be real a second?
    For just a millisecond?
    Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
    Now I'm the model of a modern major general
    The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
    Lining up to put me up on a pedestal, writing letters to relatives
    Embellishing my elegance and eloquence
    But the elephant is in the room
    The truth is in your face
    When you hear the British cannons go
    Boom!
    Any hope of success is fleeting
    How can I keep leading when the people I'm leading keep retreating?
    We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
    Knight takes rook, but look
    We are out-gunned
    (What!)
    Out-manned
    (What!)
    Out-numbered, out-planned!
    (Boom, boom, boom; boom, boom)
    We gotta make an all-out stand
    Hey yo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man
    (Boom, boom, boom; boom, boom)
    Incoming!
    They're battering down the Battery, check the damages
    (Brrah!)
    We gotta stop 'em and rob 'em of their advantages
    (Brrah!)
    Let's take a stand with the stamina God has granted us
    Hamilton won't abandon ship; yo, let's steal their cannons!
    Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray, and
    (Boom!)
    Goes the cannon, we're abandoning Kips Bay, and
    (Boom!)
    There's another ship, and
    (Boom!)
    We just lost the southern tip, and
    (Boom!)
    We gotta run to Harlem quick; we can't afford another slip
    Guns and horses giddy up
    I decide to divvy up my forces
    They're skittish as the British cut the city up
    This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
    I scream in the face of this mass mutiny:
    "Are these the men with which I am to defend America?"
    We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
    I cannot be everywhere at once, people!
    I'm in dire need of assistance
    Your Excellency, sir
    Who are you?
    Aaron Burr, sir
    Permission to state my case?
    As you were
    Sir, I was a captain under General Montgomery
    Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec, and well, in summary:
    I think that I could be of some assistance
    I admire how you keep firing on the British from a distance
    Huh
    I have some questions, a couple of suggestions
    On how to fight instead of fleeing west
    Yes?
    Well —
    Your Excellency? You wanted to see me?
    Hamilton, come in. Have you met Burr?
    Yes, sir!
    We keep meeting...
    As I was saying, sir
    I look forward to seeing your strategy play out —
    Burr?
    Sir?
    Close the door on your way out
    Have I done something wrong, sir?
    On the contrary
    I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
    Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh —
    Sir?
    Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?
    Sir!
    Don't get me wrong; you're a young man of great renown
    I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
    Nathanael Greene and Henry Knox wanted to hire you —
    Yeah, to be their secretary! I don't think so.
    Now why are you upset?
    I'm not?
    It's all right you want to fight: you've got a hunger
    I was just like you when I was younger
    Head full of fantasies of dying like a martyr
    Yes
    Dying is easy, young man; living is harder
    Why are you telling me this?
    I'm being honest
    I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
    We are a powder keg about to explode
    I need someone like you to lighten the load
    So?
    I am not throwing away my shot
    I am not throwing away my shot
    Hey yo, I'm just like my country
    I'm young, scrappy, and hungry
    I am not throwing away my shot
    Son, we are out-gunned, out-manned!
    You need all the help you can get, I have some friends:
    Laurens, Mulligan, Marquis de Lafayette! Okay, what else?
    Outnumbered, outplanned!
    We'll need some spies on the inside
    Some king's men who might let some things slide
    Boom!
    I'll write to Congress and tell them we need supplies
    You rally the guys, master the element of surprise
    Chick-a-boom!
    I'll rise above my station, organize your information
    'Til we rise to the occasion of our new nation, sir!
    Here comes the general!
    Rise up!
    What!
    Here comes the general!
    Rise up!
    What!
    Here comes the general!
    Rise up!
    What!
    Here comes the general!

    Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
    Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

    I have never been the same
    Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
    And when you said "Hi, " I forgot my dang name
    Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame
    This is not a game
    You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied
    I'm sure I don't know what you mean
    You forget yourself
    You're like me, I'm never satisfied

    I have never been satisfied
    My name is Angelica Schuyler
    Alexander Hamilton
    Where's your family from?
    Unimportant, there's a million things I haven't done
    Just you wait, just you wait
    So so so...
    So this is what it feels like to match wits
    With someone at your level! what the hell is the catch?
    It's the feeling of freedom, of seeing the light
    It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite
    You see it right?
    The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes, everything we said in total agreement!
    It's a dream and it's a bit of a dance
    A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance.
    He's a bit of a flirt, but I'mma give it a chance
    I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
    His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance
    He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants
    Handsome, boy does he know it
    Peach fuzz and he can't even grow it
    I wanna take him far away from this place
    Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is
    Helpless
    And I know she is
    Helpless
    And her eyes are just
    Helpless
    And I realize
    Three fundamental truths at the exact same time
    Where are you taking me?
    I'm about to change your life
    Then by all means, lead the way
    Number one!
    I'm a girl in a world in which
    My only job is to marry rich
    My father has no sons so I'm the one
    Who has to social climb for one
    So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
    New York City is insidious
    And Alexander is penniless
    Ha, that doesn't mean I want him any less
    Elizabeth Schuyler, it's a pleasure to meet you
    Schuyler?
    My sister!
    Number two!
    He's after me because I'm a Schuyler sister
    That elevates his status, I'd
    Have to be naive to set that aside
    Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
    Now that's his bride
    Nice going Angelica, he was right, you will never be satisfied
    Thank you for all your service
    If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it
    I'll leave you to it!
    Number three!
    I know my sister like I know my own mind
    You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
    If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
    He'd be mine
    She would say "I'm fine"
    She'd be lying
    But when I fantasize at night, it's Alexander's eyes
    As I romanticize what might have been if I hadn't sized
    Him up so quickly
    At least my dear Eliza's his wife
    At least I keep his eyes in my life
    To the groom!
    To the groom, to the groom, to the groom
    To the bride!
    To the bride
    To the bride (to the bride)
    From your sister
    Angelica, Angelica, Angelica
    Who is always by your side
    By your side, by your side

    He started saying this to anybody who would listen
    Washington cannot be left alone to his devices
    Indecisive from crisis to crisis
    The best thing he can do for the revolution
    Is turn 'n go back to planting tobacco in Mount Vernon

    What was it all for?
    Do you support this constitution?
    Of course
    Then defend it
    And what if you're backing the wrong horse?
    Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed
    For the notion of a nation we now get to build
    For once in your life, take a stand with pride
    I don't understand how you stand to the side
    I'll keep all my plans close to my chest
    (Wait for it, wait for it, wait)
    I'll wait here and see which way the wind will blow
    I'm taking my time, watching the afterbirth of a nation
    Watching the tension grow
    I am sailing off to London
    I am accompanied by someone who always pays
    I have found a wealthy husband who will
    Keep me in comfort for all my days
    He is not a lot of fun, but there's no one
    Who can match you for turn of phrase
    My Alexander
    Angelica
    Don't forget to write
    Look at where you are
    Look at where you started
    The fact that you're alive is a miracle
    Just stay alive, that would be enough
    And if your wife could share a fraction of your time
    If I could grant you peace of mind
    Would that be enough?
    Alexander joins forces with James Madison
    And John Jay to write a series of essays
    Defending the new United States Constitution
    Entitled The Federalist Papers
    The plan was to write a total of 25 essays
    The work divided evenly among the three men
    In the end, they wrote 85 essays
    In the span of six months
    John Jay got sick after writing five
    James Madison wrote 29
    Hamilton wrote the other 51
    How do you write like you're running out of time? (Running out of time?)
    Write day and night like you're running out of time? (Running out of time?)
    Every day you fight, like you're running out of time
    Like you're running out of time
    Are you running out of time? Awwww!
    How do you write like tomorrow won't arrive?
    How do you write like you need it to survive?
    How do you write every second you're alive?
    Every second you're alive? Every second you're alive?
    They're asking me to lead
    I am doing the best I can
    To get the people that I need
    I'm asking you to be my right-hand man (Treasury or State?)
    I know it's a lot to ask (Treasury or State?)
    To leave behind the world you know
    Sir, do you want me to run the Treasury or State department?

    He will never be satisfied (To be satisfied)
    Satisfied, satisfied

    Treasury Secretary, Washington's the President
    Every American experiment sets a precedent
    Not so fast, someone came along to resist him
    Pissed him off until we had a two-party system
    You haven't met him yet, you haven't had the chance
    'Cause he's been kickin' ass as the ambassador to France
    But someone's gotta keep the American promise
    You simply must meet Thomas, Thomas
    Thomas Jefferson's coming home
    Thomas Jefferson's coming home
    Thomas Jefferson's coming home
    Thomas Jefferson's coming home
    Thomas Jefferson's coming home Lord he's been off in Paris for so long
    (Aaa-ooo)

    France is following us to revolution
    There is no more status quo
    But the sun comes up and the world still spins
    I helped Lafayette draft a declaration
    Then I said, I gotta go
    I gotta be in Monticello
    Now the work at home begins
    So what'd I miss?
    What'd I miss?
    Virginia, my home sweet home, I wanna give you a kiss
    I've been in Paris meeting lots of different ladies
    I guess I basically missed the late eighties
    I traveled the wide, wide world and came back to this
    Aaa-ooo
    There's a letter on my desk from the President
    Haven't even put my bags down yet Sally be a lamb, darlin' won'tcha open it?
    It says the President's assembling a cabinet
    And that I am to be the Secretary of State, great
    And that I'm already Senate-approved
    I just got home and now I'm headed up to New York
    Headin' to New York, headin' to New York
    Lookin' at the rolling fields I can't believe that we are free
    Ready to face, whatever's awaiting
    Me in N.Y.C.
    But who's waitin' for me when I step in the place?
    My friend James Madison, red in the face
    He grabs my arm
    And I respond, what's goin' on? (Aa-oo)
    Thomas, we are engaged in a battle for our nation's very soul
    Can you get us out of the mess we're in?
    Hamilton's new financial plan is nothing less than government control
    I've been fighting for the South alone
    Where have you been?
    Uh France (aa-ooo)
    We have to win
    What'd I miss? (What'd what'd what'd I miss)
    What'd I miss? (I've come home to this)
    Headfirst into a political abyss (headfirst, into the abyss)
    I have my first cabinet meeting today (chik-a-pow)
    I guess I better think of something to say
    I'm already on my way get to the bottom of this
    (What did I miss?) aa-ooo
    Mr. Jefferson, welcome home
    Mr. Jefferson (Alexander Hamilton)

    The issue on the table, Secretary Hamilton's plan to assume state debt and establish a national bank
    Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir
    Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness
    We fought for these ideals, we shouldn't settle for less
    These are wise words, enterprising men quote 'em
    Don't act surprised, you guys, 'cause I wrote 'em (ow)
    But Hamilton forgets
    His plan would have the government assume state's debts
    Now, place your bets as to who that benefits
    The very seat of government where Hamilton sits
    Oh, if the shoe fits, wear it
    If New York's in debt, why should Virginia bear it?
    Uh, our debts are paid, I'm afraid
    Don't tax the South 'cause we got it made in the shade
    In Virginia, we plant seeds in the ground
    We create, you just wanna move our money around
    This financial plan is an outrageous demand
    And it's too many damn pages for any man to understand
    Stand with me in the land of the free and pray to God we never see Hamilton's candidacy
    Look, when Britain taxed our tea, we got frisky
    Imagine what gon' happen when you try to tax our whisky
    Thank you, Secretary Jefferson
    Secretary Hamilton, your response
    Thomas, that was a real nice declaration
    Welcome to the present, we're running a real nation
    Would you like to join us, or stay mellow
    Doin' whatever the hell it is you do in Monticello?
    If we assume the debts, the union gets new line of credit, a financial diuretic
    How do you not get it, if we're aggressive and competitive
    The union gets a boost, you'd rather give it a sedative?
    A civics lesson from a slaver, hey neighbor
    Your debts are paid 'cause you don't pay for labor
    "We plant seeds in the South. We create." Yeah, keep ranting
    We know who's really doing the planting
    And another thing, Mr. Age of Enlightenment
    Don't lecture me about the war, you didn't fight in it
    You think I'm frightened of you, man?
    We almost died in a trench
    While you were off getting high with the French
    Thomas Jefferson, always hesitant with the President
    Reticent there isn't a plan he doesn't jettison
        Madison, you're mad as a hatter, son, take your medicine
    Damn, you're in worse shape than the national debt is in
    Sittin' there useless as two shits
    Hey, turn around, bend over, I'll show you where my shoe fits
    Excuse me, Madison, Jefferson, take a walk
    Hamilton, take a walk, we're gonna reconvene after a brief recess, Hamilton
    Sir
    A word
    You don't have the votes (you don't have the votes)
    Aha-ha-ha ha
    You're gonna need congressional approval and you don't have the votes
    Such a blunder sometimes it makes me wonder why I even bring the thunder
    Why he even brings the thunder
    You wanna pull yourself together?
    I'm sorry, these Virginians are birds of a feather
    Young man, I'm from Virginia, so watch your mouth
    So we let Congress get held hostage by the South?
    You need the votes
    No, we need bold strokes, we need this plan (no, you need to convince more folks)
    James Madison won't talk to me, that's a nonstarter
    Ah, winning was easy, young man, governing's harder
    They're being intransigent
    You have to find a compromise
    But they don't have a plan, they just hate mine (convince them otherwise)
    And what happens if I don't get congressional approval?
    I imagine they'll call for your removal
    Sir
    Figure it out, Alexander, that's an order from your commander""",

    One stroke and you've consumed my waking days

    "My dearest, Angelica"
    With a comma after dearest
    You've written
    "My dearest, Angelica"

    I'm coming home this summer
    At my sister's invitation

    Take a break and get away

    We can all go stay with our father

    Remember, my decision on this matter
    Is not subject to congressional approval.
    The only person you have to convince is me.
    Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor sir.
    When we were on death's door when we were needy
    We made a promise, we signed a treaty.
    We needed money and guns and half a chance,
    Uhh who provided those funds? (France)
    In return they didn't ask for land,
    Only the promise that we'd lend a hand
    And stand with them if they fought against oppressors
    And revolution is messy but now is the time to stand.
    Stand with our brothers as they fight against tyranny.
    I know that Alexander Hamilton is here
    And he would rather not have this debate.
    I remind you that he is not Secretary of State!
    He knows nothing of loyalty. (nothing)
    Smells like new money
    Dresses like fake royalty.
    Desperate to rise above his station.
    Everything he does betrays the ideals our nation.
    Hey, and if you don't know now you know Mr. President.
    Thank you Secretary Jefferson
    Secretary Hamilton your response.
    You must be out of your GODDAMNED mind
    If you think
    The president is gonna bring the nation to the brink
    Of meddling in the middle of a military mess
    A game of chess
    Where France is queen and king-less
    We've signed a treaty with a king
    Who's head is now in a basket
    Would you like to take it out and ask it?
    "Oh should we honor our treaty King Louis head?"
    Uh do whatever you want, I'm super dead!
    Enough! Enough!
    Hamilton is right (Mr. President)
    We're too fragile to start another fight
    (But sir do we not fight for freedom)
    Sure, when the French figure out who's gonna lead 'em.
    (The people are leading!)
    The people are rioting, there's a difference
    Frankly it's a little disquieting
    You would let your ideals blind you to reality
    Hamilton? (Sir) Draft the statement of neutrality.
    Did you forget Lafayette? (What?)
    Have you an ounce of regret?
    You accumulate debt, you accumulate power
    Yet in their hour of need you forget.
    Lafayette's a smart man he'll be fine,
    And before he was your friend he was mine.
    If we try to fight in every revolution in the world
    We never stop, where do we draw the line?
    So quick witted
    Alas, I admit it
    I bet you were quite a lawyer
    My defendants got aquitted

    Alright, so this is what you're gonna do
    Stand there like a man until Eacker is in front of you
    When the time comes, fire your weapon in the air
    This will put an end to the whole affair
    But what if he decides to shoot? Then I'm a goner
    No, he'll follow suit if he's truly a man of honor
    To take someone's life, that is something you can't shake
    Philip, your mother can't take another heartbreak
    Father!
    Promise me
    You don't want this young man's blood on your conscience
    Okay, I promise
    Come back home when you're done
    Take my guns, be smart, make me proud, son
    My name is Philip
    I am a poet
    And I'm a little nervous, but I can't show it
    I'm sorry, I'm a Hamilton with pride
    You talk about my father, I cannot let it slide
    Mister Eacker, how was the rest of your show?
    I'd rather skip the pleasantries, let's go
    Grab your pistol (confer with your men)
    The duel will commence after we count to ten (count to ten!)
    Look 'em in the eye, aim no higher
    Summon all the courage you require
    Then slowly and clearly aim your gun towards the sky""",

    Most disputes die and no one shoots (number four!)
    Hamilton drew first position
    Looking, to the world, like a man on a mission

    Maybe the last face I ever see
    If I throw away my shot, is this how you'll remember me?
    What if this bullet is my legacy?
    Legacy, what is a legacy?
    It's planting seeds in a garden you never get to see
    I wrote some notes at the beginning of a song someone will sing for me
    America, you great unfinished symphony, you sent for me
    You let me make a difference, a place where even orphan immigrants
    Can leave their fingerprints and rise up
    I'm running out of time, I'm running, and my time's up
    Wise up, eyes up
    I catch a glimpse of the other side
    Laurens leads a soldiers' chorus on the other side
    My son is on the other side
    He's with my mother on the other side
    Washington is watching from the other side
    Teach me how to say goodbye
    Rise up, rise up, rise up, Eliza!
    My love, take your time
    I'll see you on the other side
    Raise a glass to freedom
    Wait!
    I strike him right between his ribs
    I walk towards him, but I am ushered away
    They row him back across the Hudson
    I get a drink
    I hear wailing in the streets (aah, aah, aah)
    Somebody tells me, "You'd better hide" (aah, aah, aah)
    They say Angelica and Eliza
    Were both at his side when he died
    Death doesn't discriminate
    Between the sinners and the saints, it takes and it takes and it takes
    History obliterates, in every picture it paints
    It paints me and all my mistakes
    When Alexander aimed at the sky
    He may have been the first one to die
    But I'm the one who paid for it
    I survived, but I paid for it
    Now I'm the villain in your history
